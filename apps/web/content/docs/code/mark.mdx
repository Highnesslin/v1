import { CodeWithNotes } from "@/components/code/code-with-notes"

## !demo

Highlight lines.

<Demo name="mark" />

## !implementation

We could do this in a few ways. One way is to have two components, one for _marked_ lines and one for lines that are not marked.

<CodeWithNotes>

```tsx ! code.tsx

```

</CodeWithNotes>

## Make it better

Some ideas to improve the mark annotation:

- Add an `InlineMark` component to mark parts of a line
- Mix it with the [`Focus annotation`](/docs/code/focus)
- use border and background colors from the theme
