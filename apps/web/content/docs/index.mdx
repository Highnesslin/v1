## Template

If you are here to try out Code Hike on a new project, you can start from this template (including Next.js, MDX, Tailwind CSS, and Code Hike v1):

```bash
npx create-next-app -e https://github.com/code-hike/v1-starter
```

You can also try it on:

- [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/github/code-hike/v1-starter)
- [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/code-hike/v1-starter)

## Manual Installation

<Steps>
<Step>

### Meta Framework

To take full advantage of Code Hike, it's best to use it from a meta-framework supporting React Server Components. At the moment, this means [Next.js with App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app).

<Callout  type="info">

We'll have good support for Docusaurus, Nextra, maybe Astro, and other React meta frameworks once the new API becomes stable.

</Callout>

If you are building a documentation site, I recommend [Fuma Docs](https://github.com/fuma-nama/next-docs), which is what this site is built with.

<Step>

### MDX

Make sure to have MDX set up. If you are using Next.js, you can follow [this guide](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/mdx).

</Step>

<Step>

### Install Code Hike

```bash
npm install codehike@alpha
```

</Step>

<Step>

### Add MDX plugins

This depends on your MDX setup. You need to add these two plugins and set `jsx` to `true`:

```js next.config.mjs
// next.config.mjs
import { remarkCodeHike, recmaCodeHike } from "codehike/mdx"

const mdxOptions = {
  remarkPlugins: [remarkCodeHike],
  recmaPlugins: [recmaCodeHike],
  jsx: true,
}
```
