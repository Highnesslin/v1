Have you ever spent one hour trying to undersand a concept from a documentation page without success, then asked a friend and they explained it in 5 minutes? That documentation page wasn't rich enough.

## Media Richness Theory

Media Richness Theory is a framework for ranking communication media based on their **ability to express complex messages**.

A scale **from leaner to richer** goes like this:

- Unaddressed documents (bulk mail, posters)
- Addressed documents (letters, email)
- Phone calls
- Video conferencing
- Face-to-face meetings

Richer doesn't mean better. When you choose a richer medium you are usually paying some type of cost. There's a reason why people say "This meeting could have been an email."

Leaner media are more cost-efficient, richer media are more expressive. That's the trade-off.

## Media Richness Theory for content websites

This framework is from 1986 and didn't age very well. But we can borrow some ideas to think about content websites.

The web is a versatile medium. It can be as lean or as rich as you want. You can build a lean website with just text, or a rich website with interactive, personalized, collaborative, multimedia content.

Remember, richness means: the ability to express complex messages.

This is especially important for technical content, where the message is usually complex and lean text-based websites aren't expressive enough to convey it.

In my opinion, **most technical content websites should be richer**.

The two reasons why they aren't are:

- **Cost**: There's a lack of tools and conventions to make rich content websites easier to build.
- **Familiarity**: Most technical content websites are just text, so people keep building text-based websites.

The familiarity problem

The trade-off between cost-efficiency and expressiveness is still there.

GitHub READMEs are a good example of lean technical content.

Landing pages are examples of rich content websites.

Rich content websites are more costly.

Imagine if companies put the same effort into their documentation as they put into their landing pages. Well, you don't have to imagine, you can visit Stripe documentation and see it for yourself.

Some of the cost is accidental, it's the lack of tools and conventions to make rich content websites easier to build.

We need to lower the cost of richer content websites, and that's the goal of Code Hike
